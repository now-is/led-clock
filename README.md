# LED Clock

Display a running 7-segment clock on a terminal.

You will need `Lua`, and the rocks [lcurses](https://luarocks.org/modules/jjandresson/lcurses) and [sleep](https://luarocks.org/modules/squeek502/sleep).

Open a sufficiently large terminal with a sufficiently small font size, set the color to the warm red from back in the compact disc jukebox days, run `./clock` and enjoy.

A big low-key display is surprisingly useful e.g. in the kitchen, actually.

Press `q` to quit. It might miss a beat, because it's okay to.

## Testing

`cd cron-absolute` and run [busted](https://luarocks.org/modules/lunarmodules/busted).

## Work in progress

Many plans. But maybe the weather next.
